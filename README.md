# YouTube Clone Project

## Description

This project is a YouTube clone that replicates some of the core features of the popular video-sharing platform. It utilizes the Rapid API's API for fetching video data, Tailwind CSS for styling, Axios for making HTTP requests, React-Icons for including scalable icons, and React-Player for embedding YouTube videos. The state management is handled using the Context API, allowing seamless data sharing between components.
